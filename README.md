# FlashCards

## About This Project

Play a game in your computer's terminal which will ask you 30 questions about coding!

Upon answering each question, the user will receive immediate feedback on whether the question was answered correctly or not. Once all of the questions have been answered, the user will see a message showing what percent of questions they answered correctly.

The user will be prompted with the option to retry all of the questions that were previously answered incorrectly or to exit the game. If the user chooses to retry previous questions, the game will start again, displaying only those questions.

If the user decides to exit the game (or answers all questions correctly on their first try) a timer will display how long the game lasted and the game will end.
